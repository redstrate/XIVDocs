These servers provide patch files that are consumed by the [patcher](/executable/ffxivupdater) and the [boot](/executable/ffxivboot) executables.

## Console updating

The PS3 and PS4 versions of the game used to use the same patch system as the Windows version. That changed [in 2018 when Square Enix moved to updating through PSN](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/2b63219b37d83601618341b5a7876d9a6c72a774). Trying to contact the patch servers with PS4 patch requests will return a 404. And of course since the PS3 version is defunct, that also doesn't work.
