There have been several benchmarks publicly released, which are [modified client executables](/executable/ffxiv) that replay several cutscenes (usually made exclusively for the benchmark) and can create character creation save data.

Despite the [official FFXIV Benchmark site](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/benchmark/) only displaying the latest expansion, all previous benchmarks are still accessible. An archive of all links are provided below.
